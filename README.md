# Raison d'etre of the repository

Summary of my notes, ideas & learnings from going through the newline course [Composing Layouts in React](https://www.newline.co/courses/composing-layouts-in-react) 

This is meant to be a personal reference guide for applying the principles of "Encapsulated CSS" when building React components. - That is  why; 

1. I chose Typescript, 
2. Organized the code in this particular manner (with respect to folder & component structure)
3. Scaffolded the project with CRA and published to github.

## TODO 
* Build an example page / component to showcase all the layout blocks working in tandem. 
* Deploy application.
